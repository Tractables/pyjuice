class BlockScaleSumParams(ExternalSumParams):
    """
    A per-sample **multiplicative gate** on each parameter block, supplied externally at call time.

    Every gate owns one scalar per sample. Writing `g(n,c)` for the gate covering the edge from node `n`
    to child `c`, the effective parameters for batch element `b` are

    .. code-block:: text

        theta_b[n, c] = phi[b, g(n,c)] * theta_shared[n, c] / Z_b[n]
        Z_b[n]        = sum_c phi[b, g(n,c)] * theta_shared[n, c]

    normalized over the children of `n`. Factoring out each gate's share of the node's mass,
    `sigma[g,n] = sum_{c in g} theta_shared[n,c]`, shows what the gate actually does:

    .. code-block:: text

        theta_b[n,c] = [ phi[b,g] sigma[g,n] / sum_{g'} phi[b,g'] sigma[g',n] ] * ( theta_shared[n,c] / sigma[g,n] )

    -- it reweights the **gate-level mixture weights** per sample and leaves each gate's internal
    conditional untouched. Two consequences follow directly:

    * it is an **exact no-op when a node has only one gate**, since the reweighting then cancels against
      the normalizer. Whether a node has several gates is entirely the caller's choice of gate sizes; a
      dense transition with one edge block and the default gate size does nothing at all.
    * a gate that does not depend on the parent node is equivalent to multiplying the child's value, i.e.
      to soft evidence on the children, which PyJuice already provides. The capability that is new here
      is a gate that depends on the parent group **and** the child group.

    **Why it is cheap.** Because `phi` is constant within a gate it pulls out of the block matmul, so in
    log space it folds into the child values as an elementwise add -- the dense per-sample parameter
    matrix is never materialized, and the tensor is `[B, num_gates]` rather than anything shaped like the
    parameters. For a 1024-state layer at `block_size = 32` that is 1 MB at batch 256.

    **Tensor layout.** One `float32` tensor of LOG gates:

    * `phi`: `[B, num_edge_blocks, n_node_gates, n_child_gates]`, where a parameter block is tiled by
      `n_node_gates = ns.block_size / block_size` gates along the node axis and
      `n_child_gates = ns.ch_block_size / ch_block_size` along the child axis.

    Axis 1 follows the column order of `ns.edge_ids`. Log space keeps the gate positive for free and makes
    the fold an add rather than a multiply.

    :note: the gate tile is deliberately NOT forced to equal the parameter block. Refining along the CHILD axis
           is free (the fold is elementwise in the child index), while refining along the NODE axis costs
           one reduction per subgroup, because a single staged tile can only serve nodes that share a
           gate. Shrinking `ns.block_size` to obtain a finer gate would instead tax the whole layer: the
           node tile of the standard kernels collapses with it, below the 16 rows an efficient MMA wants,
           and the compiled index tensors grow as `K^2 / block_size`.

    :param block_size: the GATE's block size -- how many nodes one gate spans, NOT the node's own
                       `block_size`. `None` means the node's, i.e. one gate per parameter block, and it
                       must divide the node's. Only the full block size is supported so far; splitting
                       the node axis needs a separate kernel.
    :type block_size: Optional[int]

    :param ch_block_size: the GATE's child block size -- how many children one gate spans. `None` means
                          the node's own. Any divisor is allowed and costs nothing, which is why this is
                          the axis to refine.
    :type ch_block_size: Optional[int]

    :param apply_z_correction: whether the parameter flows include the term coming from `Z`'s own
                               dependence on `theta`. See :func:`post_backward_layer`.
